Notes on things to add:
I can add my email to the page either as text with the tagline or in a contact 
me section, or maybe I can make it a clickable link. Maybe I can make it a form 
where I have them send me a message from right within the page.

Notes on things to change:
I can change the tagline to something more like "Connect with me" to engourage 
people to reach out or connect with me on LinkedIn or where ever else.
